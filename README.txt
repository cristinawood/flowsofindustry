This interactive map site was built by Cristina Wood at Ingenium: Canada's Museums of Science and Innovation in summer 2018. 
I built this using Leaflet (https://leafletjs.com/), Stamen Tiles in Terrain (http://maps.stamen.com/#terrain/12/37.7706/-122.3782) and Spectral by HTML5 UP (html5up.net | @ajlkn).
